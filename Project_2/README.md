# 605.621 - Algorithms Project 2

#### Introduction
This project implements quicksort, heapsort, and introsort. It also analyzes their
empirical run times compared to their worst case.

A git repo of the project is at: https://github.com/jmr172/algorithms/tree/master/Project_2

This project was made with Java 8. It can be run from the command line using
the following from within the src directory:

```
$ javac Project2.java && java Project2 ../input/in.txt ../output/out.txt; cat ../output/out.txt
```

* in.txt is the input for the closest pairs.
  * input files with 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 data points are provided.
* out.txt contains the output of the closest pairs calculation if necessary

All my data was generated by the python script I wrote called random_point_generator.py.
To run this program, use:
```
python3 random_point_generator.py [number_of_points]
```
